# Zur'ok - Discord Bot

This is the public repo of Zur'ok's codebase.

Zur'ok is a bot used by my friends, hosted on my Ubuntu VPS.

To run this bot, you will need a bot token from Discord, and a Mongo Database hosted on the same server,
or one hosted elsewhere that allows external connections.

The example config file located in `/config` should detail what credentials are need to get it up and running.

I have been working on and off on this code over the last 8-ish years, and have learnt a tremendous amount from this endeavour.

He has various functions, the main one is storing and recalling quotes, playing wordle, rolling dice, generating D&D stats.
